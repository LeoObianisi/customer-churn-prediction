## 🚀 Project Overview  
- Built **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models to predict churn.  
- Compared performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- Created **Tableau dashboards** to explain churn patterns visually.  
- Provided **business recommendations** for reducing churn, such as:  
  - Targeting short-tenure, high-paying customers early.  
  - Reducing churn from month-to-month contracts.  
  - Improving customer support experiences.

## 📊 Key Results  
- Logistic Regression baseline accuracy: **79%**  
- Tuned Decision Tree: **84% accuracy** and **higher recall (88%)**  
- Tableau dashboard revealed:  
  - Month-to-month contracts = highest churn risk.  
  - Fiber optic customers churn more than DSL users.  
  - Customers with frequent support calls are more likely to churn.
